Augmented reality technology is widely utilized in peopleâ€™s life and work, especially in visual aids. AR enhanced the way we acquire, understand &amp; display information without distracting from physical world. Augmented reality during this project allows users to control the information of the taken image. Our application will help users to induce information about the actual restaurant located in Pakistan without even getting in the scene. This application will provide real-time feedback &amp; reviews by providing lots of data associated which is extracted from the social sites.
